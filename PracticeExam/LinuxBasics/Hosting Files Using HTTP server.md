An HTTP server is a web server that communicates using URLs and the HTTP protocol. It is widely used to create web applications and APIs.

Letâ€™s create a file called home_page.html and host it using the Python HTTP server,
```
cat > home_page.html <<EOL <html> <body> <p>Welcome to the home page!</p> </body> </html> EOL
```
Creating the Python server is simple. Enter the following command to use the default port 80:
`python3 -m http.server 80 &`

By default, the HTTP server runs on port 8000. To use port 8000, enter the following command:
`python3 -m http.server &`
